# 📸 **Computer Vision - DSB - Yerevan State University**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Computer Vision** course at **Yerevan State University**! This repository contains all the lesson materials, homework assignments, and additional resources to help you dive deep into the exciting world of Computer Vision.

## 🌟 **Course Overview**

Computer Vision is the field of study that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data, simulating human visual understanding. From self-driving cars to facial recognition, Computer Vision plays a vital role in modern AI applications.

In this course, we will explore:

- Basics of Image Processing
- Feature Extraction Techniques
- Object Detection & Tracking
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Deep Learning in Vision
- Real-world applications of Computer Vision
